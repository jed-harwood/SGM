  Learning latent graphs from stationary signals
}
\description{
  This package offers a collection of functions to estimate a GAR(1) process, as proposed by Peng et al. in (2024).  The GAR(1) is the simplest of a collection of Spectral Graphical Models (SGM).  We provide a three-step estimation procedure for the model parameters, using an ADMM-based algorithm.  Additionally, we provide a model-selection procedure based on the eBIC criterion (Chen et al.) and a goodness of fit test.

  This section should provide a more detailed overview of how to use the
  package, including the most important functions.
