# SGM
An R package for Estimating Spectral Graphical Models

*** 
The R package `SGM` provides a set of functions that learn a latent graph from the data.  The data are viewed as stationary signals from the inferred latent graph.  `SGM` is motivated by the need to understand complex dependence structures, and how they change over time.  Currently, the package offers code to fit a GAR(1) model, through a 3-step procedure.
